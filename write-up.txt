For my dataset, I used the Adults dataset found on UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.
This dataset predicts whether income exceeds $50k/year based on census data.

For any predictors with a continuous value (age, fnlwgt, education-num, capital-gain, 
capital-loss, hours-per-week), I divided its value by the maximum number of each category.
So, for example age, I divided the age by 90, since 90 was the oldest age. That way these 
continuous predictors can have a value between 0 and 1. For the discrete predictors 
(workclass, education, marital-status, occuptation, relationship, race, sex, and native-
country), I mapped out each category using adults/mapped-data.xlsx then normalized it. 

The neural network had 12 inputs, 5 hidden nodes, and 1 output node. It was trained with a
learning rate of 0.5 and 150 epochs and yielded a macro accuracy of 82.7%. The initial 
weight was generated in a similar way to the wdbc data but shorter.
